# DISCOVER-Sentinel-Docker
This is the DISCOVER Sentinel Drone Docker with all experiments, scripts, etc.

Experiments are located in Docker/source/connorscode/src
Main flight module is SGFlightKit Core which includes a variety of flight function with different use cases.
These functions are documented on the github but not yet on the drone itself.

Many experiments may be unfinished or outdated given the current parameter set. This can cause a crash, 
so thouroughly read through the experiments and all embedded function before flying, and do simple tests
before jumping into a complex script.
